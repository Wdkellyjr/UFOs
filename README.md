# UFOs

## Over of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the project was to use a new and complex front end development language, Java Script, to add extra functions and customization so that users could use a webpage to search for interesting information regarding UFO sightings. The user could search for the information by entering date, city, state, country or shape criteria.

### Results

The webpage is very user friendly. The top, middle section of the webpage houses information explaining how the UFO sighting data was obtained. The filter search fields are on the left side of the page, right underneath “UFO Sightings: Facts of Fancy? Ufologists Weigh In” title. You can search for UFO sighting information by date, city, state, country or shape of the sittings. The search results are automatically displayed in a table format to the right of the filter search fields. Click on “UFO Sightings” in the top left-hand corner to reset the filter search fields.

### Summary

The filter search function makes is very easy to look for UFO sightings information within the provided data, but you can’t search for any sighting information outside of the dataset. It would be better if the data included sightings recorded over a range of years and would be better if the UFO sighting information was automatically updated as more information is obtained.
